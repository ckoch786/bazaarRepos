1. In order to build GNUtrition you need:

 * A working C compiler, like GCC
 * GTK+
 * intltool
 * pkg-config

2. Then, 'cd' to the directory where you unpacked GNUtrition and invoke the 
'configure' script:

	./configure

Alternatively, create a separate directory, outside the source directory, 
where you want to build GNUtrition, and invoke 'configure' from there:

	SOURCE-DIR/configure

This may not work unless you use GNU make.

'configure' attempts to deduce the correct values for various system-dependent 
variables and features.

3. When 'configure' finishes, it prints several lines of details. Read those 
details carefully looking for anything suspicious. If you find anything wrong,
you may have to pass to 'configure' one or more options. Run:

	./configure --help

To see all available options.

If you need to run the 'configure' script more than once (e.g., with some 
non-default options), always clean the source directory before running 
'configure' again:

	make distclean
	./configure

4. Invoke the 'make' program:

	make

If 'make' succeeds, it will build an executable program 'gnutrition' in the 
'src' directory. You can try this program, to make sure it works:

	src/gnutrition

5. Assuming that the program works, you can install the program:

	make install

6. You are now ready to use GNUtrition. You can delete the build directory 
if you do not plan to build GNUtrition again.
